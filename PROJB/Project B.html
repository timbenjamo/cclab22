        <h2> The History of Dole </h2>
        <p> In the early 1900s, the United Fruit Company and other menacing companies hurt and disserviced multiple local workers in Panama and surrounding countries when they started inhumane cultivation endeavours. 
            Those companies forced their way into those countries and installed puppet regimes backed by the U.S. government. This meant the local population had no choice but to work for the fruit companies. The government, welfare, and even the currency was regulated by the fruit corporations. Click the links above to listen to some of the tunes the fruit corporations created to market their products and draw focus to the issue.
