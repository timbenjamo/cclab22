        <h2> The History of Dole </h2>
        <p> During the late 19th century, many fruit companies occupied parts of Panama and other countries in South America. Unfortunately, their money making schemes were largely backed and funded by the United States government. Eventually - due to blight and the fact that the bananas were largely monoculture - the crops that these companies had grown for so long began to die. They were able to recreate a new banana; one that was disease resistant, however, people didnâ€™t want to buy it. As a result, the companies decided to market their bananas with a catchy new jingle. The Chiquita Banana song! Click the link above to play this song. </p>
